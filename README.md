# MERN To-Do List

This to-do list tracker app should support authentication against a mongodb database and store to-do items in the same database.

The app should consist of a front-end and a back-end where the front-end will make requests to the back-end to manage the to-do list items along with authentication

Passwords should be encrypted, as always
